# Cookbook
A collection of the various recipes I've gathered/collected. PRs welcome

## Format:
I'd prefer measurements to be in metric when possible. Since most ovens in North America are in Farenheit, I will probably use that for temperatures.

Ideally, each recipe will have the format of:

* Ingredients
* Preperation
* Cooking
* Interesting story about Grandmother/travel abroad/neighbor's cat (known as the "get to the point" format).
