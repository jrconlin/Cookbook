# Soda Bread Recipe:

## Ingredients

### Dry:
* 275g wholemeal flour
* 175g plain flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking soda

Optional: caraway seed, raisins.

### Wet:
* 25g butter
* ~ 275-425 ml butter milk (total should be less than < 1pt/500ml)

## Prep
* **mix dry** ingredients.
I find sifting these through a wire strainer aerates the mix as well as loosely sifts them.
* **rub in butter** until crumb
use a fork to integrate the butter into the dry ingredients.
* add optional ingredients to dry mix.
* **add 275ml buttermilk** & fold until just soft dough
may be crumbly, but should not be sticky, will hydrate while it sits. Adding small amounts of buttermilk if needed until there's not a lot of "dry mix" at the bottom of the bowl.
* **Heat oven to 400F**
(place iron skillet or baking sheet in oven and let warm up) and let dough rest while oven warms up (around 10+ min)
* **turn dough out** onto lightly floured surface and
* **LIGHTLY knead** to remove large cracks and merge lumps
* **form into round**, place on lightly oiled skillet or floured baking sheet
* **cut cross in dough**

## Baking
* **bake for 40-45 minutes** (or until bottom sounds hollow when knocked).
* **Let cool** for 30-45 minutes
* Serve with butter and tea.

I find using a mix of wheat and all purpose four works best for flavor and texture. Your flavors may vary. I've also used different ratios of wheat and all purpose. I've also used whole meal pastry flour and it works really well.

As for the "crumb", normally, when making scones, you're using a lot more butter, so it's easy to tell when the butter has started to crumb and the dough looks, well, crumbly with no large chunks of butter. Here, there's a LOT less butter per flour, so you're more looking to incorporate it so that there's not a lot of big lumps of butter. A fork works really well here.

As for how "wet" the loaf should be, that's something I'm still trying to work out. It's a quick bread, so you're not really going to develop a whole lot of gluten. Instead. you want something between a muffin and bread. Basically, slightly damp Play-doh, with no little piles of dry mix dust at the bottom of the bowl.

Likewise, "kneading" is being generous here. You just want to meld the big lumpy bits together as much as you can, not great a silky smooth loaf.

I have found that pre-heating the skillet really helps make a well developed loaf. Adding a bit of oil (just rubbed around the pan) helps keep things from sticking.

As for the "cross", the idea is to let the steam out of the loaf and give some room for the bread to rise through the skin. I tend to cut all the way through, but feel free to stop about half way down.

I have a recipe from my Grandmother who learned as a child in Roscommon Ireland. It was transcribed by my Brooklyn NY Mom. It's.. not very good. Possibly due to the age-old grandmother problem of "use enough/this much" measurment system, but it's basically these ingredients. Needless to say, I'm still trying to reverse engineer technique, so if anyone has suggestions, I'm wide open.
