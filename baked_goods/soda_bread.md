# Soda Bread Recipe:

## Ingredients

### Dry:
* 275g plain (all-purpose) flour
* 175g whole wheat flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking soda

Optional: .25 tsp caraway seed, raisins.

### Wet:
* 50g butter
* ~ 275-425 ml butter milk (total should be less than < 1pt/500ml)

## Prep
* **mix dry** ingredients.
I find sifting these through a wire strainer aerates the mix as well as loosely sifts them.
* **rub in butter** until crumb
use a fork to integrate the butter into the dry ingredients.
* add optional ingredients to dry mix.
I will sometimes grind the carroway seeds, and as for raisins, I like golden and about a palmful.
* **add 275ml buttermilk** & fold until just soft dough may be crumbly, but should not be sticky, will hydrate while it sits. Adding small amounts of buttermilk if needed until there's not a lot of "dry mix" at the bottom of the bowl.
I've started using a standing mixer with a bread hook to mix and knead the dough. You want to mix until there's no dry left. You may need to add very small (think tsp pours) of buttermilk to the dough to get the last bits of dry up. It should look more than a bit like play-dough.
* **Heat oven to 400F**
(place iron skillet or baking sheet in oven and let warm up) and let dough rest while oven warms up (around 10+ min).
* **turn dough out** onto lightly floured surface and
* **LIGHTLY knead** to remove large cracks and merge lumps. Again, you're just pressing the bits together, not buildling up gluten.
* **form into round**, place on lightly oiled skillet or floured baking sheet
* **cut cross in dough**

## Baking
* **bake for 40-45 minutes** (or until bottom sounds hollow when knocked).
* **Let cool** for 30-45 minutes
* Serve with butter and tea.

Let me start by saying that Soda Bread isn't sweet. Sweets were a fairly rare treat in Ireland so the idea of adding hard sugar bits or drizzling an icing on a loaf is a bit like saying you need to add royal creme frosting to a hamburger.

Soda bread is a quickbread. "Quick" as in "to make" so there's no real need to let this dough rise for hours. The 10-15 minutes it rests while the oven warms is more than enough, and is mostly to have the flour hydrate from the buttermilk.

Oh, yeah, so buttermilk is what's left after you take the butter out of whole milk. Basically, it's skim or non-fat milk. Buttermilk in the US is basically "almost yogurt". I like the tang, so I use US style buttermilk, but feel free to use more "authentic" skim, just realize you may want to increase the butter you add back in.

I find using a mix of wheat and all purpose four works best for flavor and texture. Your flavors may vary. I've also used different ratios of wheat and all purpose. I've also used whole meal pastry flour and it works really well.

As for the "crumb" when mixing in the butter, normally, when making scones, you're using a lot more butter, so it's easy to tell when the butter has started to crumb and the dough looks, well, crumbly with no large chunks of butter. Here, there's a LOT less butter per flour, so you're more looking to incorporate it so that there's not a lot of big lumps of butter. A fork works really well here.

As for how "wet" the loaf should be, that's something I'm still trying to work out. It's a quick bread, so you're not really going to develop a whole lot of gluten. Instead. you want something between a muffin and bread. Basically, slightly damp Play-doh, with no little piles of dry mix dust at the bottom of the bowl.

Likewise, "kneading" is being generous here. You just want to meld the big lumpy bits together as much as you can, not great a silky smooth loaf.

I have found that pre-heating the skillet really helps make a well developed loaf. Adding a bit of oil (just rubbed around the pan) helps keep things from sticking.

As for the "cross", the idea is to let the steam out of the loaf and give some room for the bread to rise through the skin. I tend to cut all the way through, but feel free to stop about half way down.

I have a recipe from my Grandmother who learned as a child in Roscommon Ireland. It was transcribed by my Brooklyn NY Mom. It's.. not very good. Possibly due to the age-old grandmother problem of "use enough/this much" measurment system, but it's basically these ingredients. Needless to say, I'm still trying to reverse engineer technique, so if anyone has suggestions, I'm wide open.
