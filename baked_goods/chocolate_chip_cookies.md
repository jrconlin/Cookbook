# JR's chocolate chip cookies

## Ingredients:
### Dry:

* 200g flour (cake/pastry flour is best, all-purpose works well)
* 1.5 tsp baking **powder**
* 0.5 tsp salt
* 1/3 - 1/5 of a grated nutmeg (don't use pre-grated nutmeg. It's sawdust.)
* 250g chocolate chips (dark is better than milk)

### Wet:
* 113g / 1 stick unsalted butter
* 1 jumbo egg
* 210g Turbinado Sugar (AKA "Sugar in the Raw" or That Browish Sugar With The Big Crystals)
* 1.5 tblsp pure vanilla extract (Yes, it's a lot. Yes, it's good.)

## Pre prep:
Optional, but you may want to put the mixing bowl in the fridge or freezer to get it's temperature down.

I prefer to line my cookie sheets with parchment paper. If you've not used parchment paper: it's cheap and get ready to have your world blown open. Each cookie tray will hold about a dozen cookies. Each batch is about 24 cookies. Plan accordingly.

## Prep:
* Sift dry ingredients into large bowl. (Nutmeg probably won't sift, so fork stir it in.)
* Cream Sugar and Butter in standing mixer
* Add egg & vanilla to creamed butter/sugar, mix until blended.
* With blender on LOWEST setting slowly add dry ingredients until dough is smooth.
* Scrape down bowl and mixer, incorporate chocolate chips into dough, probably with a spatula and not the mixer.
* Place dough in fridge to firm up while heating oven to 365 F (185 C)
* Divvy up dough using two teaspoons to measure and place cookies.

## Baking:
* Bake cookies for 12-16 minutes. less time for chewy, longer for crunchy. You may need to rotate the cookie tray half way so keep an eye on them.
* Cool cookies for 10 minutes before devouring.

As with all things in life, the better your ingredients, the better your cookies. This is particularly true about the vanilla and nutmeg. It's absolutely worth spending a bit more on better quality stuff because you're absolutely going to taste the difference.

Also, turbinado sugar is woefully underrated for cookies. It gives a hint of molasses and a nice caramel crunch. That's why I don't load up with other sugars, you don't need them.
