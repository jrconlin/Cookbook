Everyone has a scone recipe. This is because most folks don't know what scones are supposed to taste like.
Scones should not be sweet. They're supposed to go with afternoon tea and be served with butter and jam (that's the sweet).
A good scone is crunchy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.

If you do want to store these, use a ziplock bag or an old bag you got when you last bought your veggies. You don't want these to dry out too much otherwise you're going to lose a tooth.
